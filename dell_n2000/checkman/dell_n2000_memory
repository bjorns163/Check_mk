title: Dell N2000/3000 series switches: RAM usage
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/dell

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the RAM usage on Dell N2000/N3000 series switches.

 A single service will be created showing the memory usage.

 The state of the check will return a WARNING value, if the percentage memory used 
 exceeds the warning threshold, and is less then the critical threshold. If the
 memory usage value exceeds the critical threshold, the check returns a CRITICAL state.

 At the moment the check seems to be working fine with DELL N2048 and N3024 switches,
 however the service check may work with other models.

examples:
 It is possible to over-ride the default WARNING and CRITICAL threshold values
 defined above, by ensuring the following variable configuration is set in
 your local main.mk file.

 # Indicate warning at 50% CPU load, and indicate critical for 60%
 dell_n2000_memory_default_levels = (50, 60)

perfdata:
 A chart uses a single variable the memory percentage (0..100) representing
 the state of the RAM used at the time the check occurred.

inventory:
 During the inventory phase of check_mk, it will identify the service {CPU},
 as long as the appropriate MIB is supported on the switch.

[parameters]
warning (int): The RAM usage percentage at which a warning state is triggered.
critical (int): The RAM usage percentage at which a critical state is triggered.

[configuration]
dell_n2000_memory_default_levels(int, int): The Default percentage values used by the inventory checks.
 These variables are pre-set to {(80, 90)}.
